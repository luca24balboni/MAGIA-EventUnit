This repo contains MAGIA (**M**esh **A**rchitecture for **G**enerative **I**ntelligence **A**cceleration), an open-source large-scale accelerator designed for Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). MAGIA is a network of Tiles that have at their heart [RedMulE](https://github.com/pulp-platform/redmule) for General Matrix Multiply (GeMM) acceleration, [iDMA](https://github.com/pulp-platform/iDMA) for fast and efficient data movement and an L1 scratchpad memory (SPM). Tiles are connected to a mesh Network-on-Chip (NoC) - [FlooNoC](https://github.com/pulp-platform/FlooNoC) - used for communication, and a dedicated network for synchronization - [FractalSync](https://github.com/VictorIsachi/fractal_sync). MAGIA is designed to support matrices of sizes that vary by orders of magnitude, and also sparse matrix multiplication. 

MAGIA is developed as part of the [PULP](https://pulp-platform.org/) project, a joint effort between ETH Zurich and the University of Bologna.

## ‚≠ê Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

MAGIA uses [bender](https://github.com/pulp-platform/bender) to manage its dependencies and to automatically generate compilation scripts.

### Simulation

The following *optional* parameters can be specified:

`mesh_dv`: **0**|**1** (**Default**: 1). 0 simulation of a single Tile; 1 simulation of the entire Mesh.

`fast_sim`: **0**|**1** (**Default**: 0). 0 faster simulation that does not track signals; 1 simulation that tracks signals (for debugging).

`gui`: **0**|**1** (**Default**: 0). 0 simulation without GUI; 1 simulation with GUI.

`test`: **tile_test**|**mesh_test** (**Default**: mesh_test). Specifies which tests should be run. More fine-grain tests are available, see `sw/tests`.

**Instructions to build HW/SW and run simulations**:

**1)** Setup the *environment* (`magia` folder):
```bash
source setup_env.sh
```
**2)** Download *Bender* (`magia` folder):
```bash
make bender
```
**3)** Clone the *dependencies* and generate the *compilation script* (`magia` folder):
```bash
make update-ips > update-ips.log <mesh_dv>
```
**3\*)** Apply FlooNoC *patch* - **currently FlooNoC requires this step but should not be needed it in the future** (`magia` folder):
```bash
make floonoc-patch
```
**4)** *Build* the hardware (`magia` folder):
```bash
make build-hw > build-hw.log <mesh_dv> <fast_sim>
```
**5)** *Comile* the test code (`magia` folder):
```bash
make all <test>
```
**6)** *Run* test (`magia` folder):
```bash
make run <test> <gui> <mesh_dv>
```

**Full example**:
```bash
source setup_env.sh
make bender
make update-ips > update-ips.log
make build-hw > build-hw.log fast_sim=1
make all test=fsync_test
make run test=fsync_test
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

![](doc/MAGIA.png)

### Tile
At the heart of the architecture lies the MAGIA Tile containing a GeMM accelerator, a DMA engine, a multi-banked L1 SPM and a lightweight control core. The L1 features interleaved memory banks that compose the Tightly-Coupled Data Memory (TCDM). Each tile has access to the global L2 and to a subset of other tiles‚Äô L1, accessing the latter via remote direct memory access (RDMA). Inter-tile and global communication is carried out through a 2-channel 32-bit [AXI4](https://github.com/pulp-platform/axi) crossbar (XBAR). External tiles and the core access the L1 through an OpenBus Interface ([OBI](https://github.com/pulp-platform/obi)) XBAR and an atomic memory operation (AMO) hardware module.

Each tile is controlled by a [CV32E40X](https://github.com/pulp-platform/cv32e40x). The system has been extended with custom instructions to program and control the iDMA, RedMulE, and FractalSync. These instructions are implemented using eXtension Interface. A dedicated module dispatches instructions not meant for the core to the appropriate module.

### Mesh
Replicating the MAGIA tile, we scale up to a homogeneous two-dimensional (2D) mesh of compute tiles. The NoC allows access to the global west-side L2 via a number of interfaces equal to the number of rows. The mesh features a 2D XY topology with 32-bit physical links. The conversion between the AXI4 protocol, used by the compute tiles, and the network-level protocol is performed by Network Interfaces (NIs) between each tile and the near router.

Rendez-vous among tiles are managed through the FractalSync (FS) mechanism and the dedicated H-tree network.

### Memory map
L1 size: 1 MB Total (896kB Usable - 64kB Stack, 64kB Reserved (e.g. synchronization)).

L2 size: 1 GB.

## üß∞ Changing number of Tiles
**Supported Mesh Configurations**: `2x2`, `4x4`, `8x8`, `16x16`, `32x32`

**Scripts**: The `num_cores` parameter in the `Makefile` specifies for how many core stack traces should be generated.

**Tests**  : The `MESH_X_TILES` and `MESH_Y_TILES` parameters in `magia_utils.h` specifie the number of Tiles and allows the derivation of the appropriate data and syncrhonization networks.

**RTL/TB** : The `N_TILES_X` and `N_TILES_Y` parameters in `magia_pkg.sv` adapt the software stack to the specific mesh configuration.
