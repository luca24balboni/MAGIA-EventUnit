# RedMulE Mesh

This repo contains RedMulE Mesh (WIP), a network of [RedMulE](https://github.com/pulp-platform/redmule) tiles designed to extend the latter to support matrices of sizes that vary by orders of magnitude, and also sparse matrix multiplications.

RedMulE Mesh is developed as part of the [PULP](https://pulp-platform.org/) project, a joint effort between ETH Zurich and the University of Bologna.
